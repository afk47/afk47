## Currently Working on:

### Loot Goblin
Im making a roguelike 3D game in the vein of Lethal Company and Deeprock Galactic, essentially a goblin themed dungeon crawler with multiplayer VOIP

## Past Project(s)
[![Goblin Survivor](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=afk47&repo=GoblinSurvivor)](https://github.com/afk47/GoblinSurvivor)

GBA Game using the [Butano](https://github.com/GValiente/butano) Engine, Inspired by [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/) for the GBAJAM24

[![Leviathan](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=afk47&repo=Leviathan-Engine)](https://github.com/afk47/Leviathan-Engine)

C++ Game engine I Worked on for about a month as a way to teach myself C++, I got OBJ files to load and render and shelved the project to work on other things


## Other Projects ive worked on:

### [ShortStaf](https://shortstaf.com) 
I worked on the backend of Android and IOS in Swift and Java, moving the project into a single react native project streamlining cross-platform development for the rest of the team


### [Inker](https://syncc23.itch.io/inker)
Small gamejam game I made in unity with a small team, first game I've "Completed"
It's a platformer where you reveal the level as you go by shooting ink or touching the surface, ran low on time so it's lacking a lot of polish
